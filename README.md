# Iteration-1-Project
My version 3 of prototype. My aim is to produce a functional game for the tablet/mobile device

My Plans:

Monday 4th March 2019 - Working on the sprite sheet and making the config operational

Tuesday 5th March 2019 - I understood the touch controls for the smartphone
 - learnt .setInteractive() was very useful for creating my controls.

Wednesday 6th March 2019 - Created the movement and jump buttons

Thursday 7th March 2019 - Applied the code logic to my buttons
